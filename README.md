### Description

### Technical Achievement Description
* Added different kinds of graphics primitives, including circles, rectangles, lines, polygons
* Able to manipulate the shape and color of those geometries
* Animated geometries with changes in color, shape, and position
* Used call-back function to make the animation continuous

### Design Achievement Description
* The idea of the geometry composition and the animation is to demonstrate different ways of visualizing the volume control. The change of the geometry shape/position and colors cleary conveys the message of controling the target value up and down.
